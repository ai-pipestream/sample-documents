This is a sample Outlook MSG format email for testing purposes.

MSG files are Microsoft's proprietary email format used by Outlook.

The parser should be able to extract:
- Subject line
- Sender and recipient information
- Message body content
- Timestamps
- Any attachments (if present)

This helps ensure compatibility with Microsoft email formats.

Outlook User
